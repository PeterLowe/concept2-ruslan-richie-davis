Features points
[RG] An action rpg that is set in a wide environment in space. Instead of fighting in older times on earth- we took the concept and adapted in to a space theme
so our player can travel to different planets and assasinate different alien dictators and leaders in order to perserve peace. There will be a focus on anti gravity
parkour and free roaming through space and planets.
