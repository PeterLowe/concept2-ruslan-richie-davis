[RG] An action rpg that is set in a wide environment in space. Instead of fighting in older times on earth- we took the concept and adapted in to a space theme
so our player can travel to different planets and assasinate different alien dictators and leaders in order to perserve peace. There will be a focus on anti gravity
parkour and free roaming through space and planets.

Market analysis
[RG]This game takes elements from popular games like previous assasinscreed games, the witcher and a space elements
similar to what is found in Destiny 2. Our target audience would be teenagers 13+ and young adults, as they will have more freedom to purchase in game 
items in order to increase our sales profit, the environment is also exciting for this age range. We expect this game to
overtake every other assasincreed game as the element of space just improves a game tenfold. Our Revenue is expected to be 3 billion
as we will also introduce more micro transactions as well as having a price tag of $60.
